b"Heyo and Welcome!\nABOUT ME\nMy name is Kevin Jantar also known as PolarisSketches , I'm a Filipino aspiring artist. I've been drawing traditionally ever since I was a kid. I've only really started using Digital back in late 2016.\nI draw in a style of anime and furry and I hoped that one day I would be able to make something out of my style and develop and grow even more as an artist. With a little help from supporters, I may be able to achieve that.\nWHERE WOULD THE PLEDGES BE GOING?\nMostly payments for the monthly bills, I'm basically unemployed so I dedicate all my time drawing and do commissions in order to earn money. I would really really appreciate all the support I could get, even just a dollar would be a lot!\nCONSIDER SUPPORTING ME\nIf you've been following me on my social media before then you can join me on my journey of Improvement and self discovery here on Patreon!
