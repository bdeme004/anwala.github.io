b'Goldman Sachs takes a look at what a US-China trade deal might look like\nBy\nWhatsApp\nGoing forward, the process to reach a trade deal could take place in three phases, Goldman said.\nMost immediately, U.S. and Chinese officials are likely to continue meeting over the next few weeks to work out differences on the outstanding issues.\nThe second phase will likely result in a Trump-Xi meeting in late March where unresolved issues are ironed out, said the investment bank.\nIf the Florida meeting takes place, Goldman predicts there would be a 75 percent probability that the two presidents announce a formal agreement of some kind.\nThe ongoing negotiations have included thorny issues between both countries, such as enforcing punishment for intellectual property theft, technology transfer and structural reforms related to trade and economic policies.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat said, we expect that whatever is agreed at that point will lack specifics in many areas and that additional technical work will still need to be done after the presidential meeting takes places,\xe2\x80\x9d it said in the report.\nThe third phase \xe7\xaa\xb6 which would be the most unclear in the outcome \xe7\xaa\xb6 is enforcing of the agreement, where the issue of tariff rates will raise some uncertainty, said Goldman Sachs in its report.\n'
