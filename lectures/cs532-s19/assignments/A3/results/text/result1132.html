b'He Took Down the Elite at Davos. Then He Came for Fox News.\nImage\nRutger Bregman is part of a wider wave of young thinkers who will not accept piecemeal technocratic responses to the economic and ecological challenges of our age.CreditCreditMerlijn Doomernik/Hollandse Ho\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe9\xbb\x8dgte/Redux\nMarch 1, 2019\nAMSTERDAM \xe7\xaa\xb6 First, Rutger Bregman came for the globalists.\nIn late January at Davos, the Swiss resort where the world\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 political and financial elites gather each winter, Mr. Bregman bluntly asked why his hosts do not pay more tax.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xact feels like I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa6 at a firefighters\xe7\xaa\xb6 conference and no one is allowed to speak about water,\xe7\xaa\xb6 he said. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9e\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb5e got to be talking about taxes,\xe7\xaa\xb6 he added. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8baxes, taxes, taxes.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nThree weeks later, the young Dutch historian came for the nationalists.\nInvited on Fox News by Tucker Carlson, who described his earlier outburst as \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x99ne of the great moments in Davos history,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Mr. Bregman quickly questioned his host\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 sincerity and accused him of being a mouthpiece for the billionaire class.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xb8ou\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e all like: \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe6\xa5\xbch, I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa6 against the globalist elite, blah, blah, blah,\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x90\xae\xc2\x80 Mr. Bregman, 30, told Mr. Carlson, who responded with a foul-mouthed rant. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xact\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 not very convincing.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nTo the extent that bookish economic historians can rampage, Mr. Bregman is on one. And the world has taken notice: Videos of the two incidents have been watched millions of times across dozens of websites, and Mr. Bregman has been inundated with hundreds of interview requests. (In a statement, Mr. Carlson said no one has ever told him what to say on the air.)\nOn a cloudy recent day in Amsterdam, Mr. Bregman was bashful about the reasons for his newfound celebrity.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xact\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 entertainment, right?\xe7\xaa\xb6 Mr. Bregman said. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\x9comeone taking down Tucker Carlson is just good fun, let\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 be honest.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nThen again, Mr. Bregman has been saying these kinds of things for years \xe7\xaa\xb6 calling for higher taxes, a shorter working week and a universal basic income \xe7\xaa\xb6 and never captured the global imagination the way he has this past month.\nThat, he said, is because \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x99f something bigger that is happening.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nMr. Bregman is part of a wider wave of young activists, thinkers and politicians that includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , the 29-year-old new Democratic congresswoman, and Greta Thunberg , the 16-year-old climate protester, whose radical alternatives have, crucially, begun to garner mainstream acceptance.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhe success of these kind of things, and the extraordinary rise of someone like A.O.C., are all symptoms of the times,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Mr. Bregman said. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhe whole zeitgeist is shifting.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nImage\nMr. Bregman is part of a wider wave of young activists, thinkers and politicians that includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , center, the 29-year-old new Democratic congresswoman, whose radical alternatives have begun to garner mainstream acceptance.CreditErin Schaff for The New York Times\nBut what is specific to thinkers like Mr. Bregman is the ideological context, or lack thereof, in which they came of age.\nHe grew up in the decades either side of the millennium, in which grand ideological battles were considered to be a thing of the past.\nCentrist politicians like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair \xe7\xaa\xb6 and here in the Netherlands, Wim Kok \xe7\xaa\xb6 instead sought to triangulate between Left and Right, and to tinker here and there with the status quo rather than articulating bold visions of the future.\nBut when the economic crisis struck in 2008, revealing how that status quo was not nearly as inevitable as previously assumed, it left an ideological vacuum. The far right has filled part of it, but so have parties and thinkers on the left, among them Mr. Bregman, who combines a detailed approach to economic policy with a utopian vision of a better future.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa9e is a very practical person,\xe7\xaa\xb6 said Bas Heijne , a leading Dutch essayist and commentator. But \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x82e wants to reinvigorate idealism, and in that sense he\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 very much part of his generation.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nHis prominence over the past month is, nevertheless, something of an accident. His fiery performance at Davos was a last-minute decision. He didn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 initially intend to talk about tax.\nHis Fox appearance also almost never saw the light of day. Mr. Carlson refused to broadcast it, and Mr. Bregman was ambivalent about releasing his own recording on social media, wary of endorsing a kind of confrontational public discourse that leaves little room for dialogue.\nAt the same time, his piercing of the global consciousness has been a long time in the making.\nMr. Bregman is already the author of four books \xe7\xaa\xb6 most notably, \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x91topia for Realists,\xe7\xaa\xb6 which was published in the Netherlands in 2014, reached the United States two years ago, and has been translated into 32 languages.\nIn the book, which careens between anecdote, academic research and statistics in the manner of a more politically-radical Malcolm Gladwell, Mr. Bregman sets out an idealistic vision that many would dismiss as pure fantasy.\nHe argues for a 15-hour working week, a world without borders and a basic salary for every citizen (the Utopian part), while highlighting examples of how these policies have already been partially implemented in recent history (the realist bit).\nHe tells readers of how a universal basic income, a concept now considered far-fetched, was in fact almost introduced in the United States during the Nixon presidency, and how an iteration of it was supported by Milton Friedman, the neoliberal economist.\nImage\nGreta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate activist, center-right, during a school strike outside the Swedish Parliament in Stockholm.

He opted against embarking on a doctorate, and instead joined The Correspondent at its launch in 2013.\nWhile most historians conduct their research at universities, Mr. Bregman is a kind of in-house historian at The Correspondent, an innovative Dutch outlet whose reporters are encouraged to take their time, write about topics far from the news cycle and keep their readers informed of their research.\nHe works like an academic researcher, plunging for weeks into the history of policies like the universal basic income, surfacing every month or so with a new article. The ensuing work provided him with the basis for \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x91topia for Realists.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nUnsurprisingly, he has attracted some brickbats, even from the left.\nMr. Heijne, the essayist, admires Mr. Bregman, but feels his focus on economic solutions comes at the expense of questions of identity and belonging that have become central to current social tensions.\nOther leftist critics fear Mr. Bregman\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 version of a basic income would mean an end to the welfare state \xe7\xaa\xb6 or just wouldn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 work in practice.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9hen his self-styled utopia is widened to include completely open national borders,\xe7\xaa\xb6 wrote John Harris in the New Statesman , a British political magazine, \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xb3verything threatens to fall apart.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nMr. Bregman is not immune to such doubts himself. But, ultimately, he argues that it is only by dreaming about what seems to be unachievable that society can make good things possible.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xact\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 pretty clear that 30 years from now things will be considered common sense that are seen as completely bizarre nowadays,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Mr. Bregman said.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhe question is: Will history move in the right direction? And I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa6 not sure about that. But I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa6 doing my best to contribute.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Ruffling Feathers in a Global Conversation on Income.
