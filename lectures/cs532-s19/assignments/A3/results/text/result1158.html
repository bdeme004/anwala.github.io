b'Rampage the level 5 Halfling Berserker by Distortion3933\nCharacter\nTales of Maj\'Eyal: Age of Ascendancy 1.5.10\nAddons\nAshes of Urh\'Rok 1.5.0\nOfficial Expansion!\nMany in Maj\'Eyal have heard of "demons", sadistic creatures who appear seemingly from nowhere, leaving a trail of suffering and destruction whereever they go.  Their Fearscape floats far above the skies, watching and waiting, but not idly; their agents scout the land, their legions build up their forces, and their scholars develop new spells and strategies.  As the barrier between our worlds begins to crack under their scrutiny, helpless Eyalites have begun to disappear, whisked up to serve as their slaves and playthings.  They imbue these victims with magical powers to better survive the ensuing stresses - can you use your new-found abilities to escape the legions of Mal\'Rok?\nFeatures:\nStart with a new class, the Doombringer!  These avatars of demonic destruction charge into battle with massive two-handed weapons, cutting swaths of firey devastation through hordes of opponents.  Armed with flame magic and demonic strength, they delight in fighting against overwhelming odds, softening up the crowd with waves of fire, then feeding on the flames and suffering of their surroundings to stay alive while quickly reducing any group to a pile of ash and gore.\nUnlock a new class, the Demonologist, with an all-new item enhancement mechanic!  Bearing a shield and the magic of the Spellblaze itself, these melee-fighting casters can grow demonic seeds from their fallen enemies.  Imbue these seeds onto your items to gain a wide array of new talents and passive benefits, and summon the demons within them to fight on your side!  Ever looked at a gigantic demon-cursed minotaur and wished it was on your side for once?  Well, now you CAN summon one to pound your foes into paste while you cast devastating spells from afar, or call forth a squad of Fire Imps to pelt your enemies to death while they exhaust themselves on your impenetrable defenses!  Demons have persistent health, making them a little more precious than disposable necromancer skeletons or summoner beasts, but can be revived from death nonetheless.\nTwo new zones, with all-new art, foes, and bosses!  You\'ve seen the plains of the Fearscape before, now see the lairs and headquarters of the demons themselves!\nOver 10,000 words of written lore to find!  The demons were once an enlightened, peaceful race, hailing from a distant planet known as Mal\'Rok; learn what drove them to plot Eyal\'s eternal torture!  Discover monuments to each of the demonic species and noteworthy individuals, showing the place of honor each has among them!  Get a glimpse into the culture and daily lives of these sadistic invaders and their brainwashed thralls!\nUnlock a new race, Doomelves: Shalore who\'ve taken to the demonic alterations especially well, corrupting their typical abilities into a darker form.  Blink away to safety, transform into a shadowy d\xef\xbe\x83\xef\xbd\xbaathedlen to hide in the shadows or prey on your foes with blasts of darkness, use your new resilience to soak up status effects and critical hits, and assault your enemies\' minds to leave them unsteady in combat!\nBetween the aforementioned classes and Doomelves, a whopping 75 new talents!\nUnlock two new cosmetic options!  You know you\'ve always wanted demon-horns.\nTwo new events, appearing anywhere in Eyal!\n20 new artifacts, with unique and interesting effects.

Conquer the worst Urh\'Rok\'s forces can throw at you, and hang their metaphorical skulls from your profile page!\nEmbers of Rage 1.5.0\nOfficial Expansion!\nOne year has passed since the one the Orcs call the "Scourge from the West" came and single-handedly crushed the Orc Prides of Grushnak, Vor, Gorbat, and Rak\'Shor.\xc2\xa0 The Allied Kingdoms, now linked by farportal to their distant, long-lost Sunwall allies, have helped them conquer most of Var\'Eyal.\xc2\xa0 The few remnants of the ravaged Prides are caged...\xc2\xa0 but one Pride remains.\xc2\xa0 Kruk Pride, isolated on an island, is the last orcish settlement that stands; they, too, face their impending doom.\xc2\xa0 The Sunwall has blockaded the only exit point from the island, and now, the technologically advanced civilization of Steam Giants have come down from the mountains to take their homeland with machines and weaponry unlike anything else on Eyal.\xc2\xa0 Kruk Pride has reverse-engineered their technology before; their only hope is to do it again and rise up against the Pride\'s foes.\n\xc2\xa0\nFeatures:\nExplore a whole new campaign from level 1 to 50, one year after the events of the original Tales of Maj\'Eyal campaign.

Discover their stories, their pains, their hopes... and their awesome racial powers!\nRisk your life in over 20 unique zones! Explore the ruins of a lost city, lay siege to the Sunwall forces at the Gates of Morning, and raid the Steam Giants\' mining quarry - each has its own unique foes and hazards, leading each to feel and play different from the others.\nPlay as one of the three new tinker classes: Gunslingers, Sawbutchers, and Psyshots!

Pump lead into foes with big guns, quick guns, and explosive guns! Shred them with saws that maim, saws that thirst for blood, and saws that aren\'t really saws! Violate common sense by strapping a rocket to your back and calling it a jetpack!\nEnjoy dying in horrible and exotic ways at the hands (or claws, jaws, guns...) of over 140 new creatures! Not mere piles of stats and chain-stuns, these foes will provide unique challenges - suffer the Sunwall\'s newest cosmic spells, the new breeds of ritches that infest and multiply, the Steam Giants\' elaborate defense systems, and find new strategies to adapt to each!\nEarn a trunkload of achievements! Have your accomplishments recognized for liberating the Orcish people, displaying exceptional mercy or cruelty, or showing your prowess with impressive feats! Give a boss a fate worse than death, show Sunwall forces how frustrating it is to fight a Radiant Horror as a paladin, come out on top against impossible odds, display a suicidal lack of situational awareness, and wear a badge of pride or shame for each!\nRead roughly 27,000 words of new lore to immerse yourself in the world! Learn how things have changed since the Scourge\'s campaign, feel hatred and/or pity for your foes, uncover grand schemes and sinister plots, and notice the elaborate connections between Var\'Eyal\'s numerous factions.
