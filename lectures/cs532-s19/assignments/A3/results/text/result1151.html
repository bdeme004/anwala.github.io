Generally, they\xe2\x80\x99re welcomed, but CPAC can be fraught for journalists who regularly cover the fringes of the right. On Friday, for example, right-wing conspiracy theorist\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0Laura Loomer pestered journalists from mainstream outlets. We asked some of the reporters present about their 2019 CPAC experiences.\nChristopher Mathias\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0\nIt appears CPAC gave anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer media credentials?

From what I heard, [CPAC] can be kind of contentious. There are different factions, and they\xe2\x80\x99re arguing over things. But this basically feels like a four-day Trump rally. I\xe2\x80\x99m not nervous or tense; I\xe2\x80\x99m used to them.\nAny weird run-ins?\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0\xe2\x80\x9cI was going down the escalator\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0and there was a group of guys going up the escalator and one of them screamed \xe2\x80\x98Hey Chris Mathias, I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t make it through the next round of job cuts at HuffPost.\xe2\x80\x99 He was wearing a blue suit and a cross; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t place him. But then I saw a photo\xe2\x80\xa6the guy that screamed at me ended up being one of [white nationalist]\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0Nick Fuentes\xe2\x80\x98s crew. That\xe2\x80\x99s been it as far as harassment.\xe2\x80\x9d\nJared Holt\n\xe2\x80\x94 Jared Holt (@jaredlholt) March 1, 2019\nOutlet: Right Wing Watch\nYears on the right-wing beat: Two.\nHow does this CPAC compare to others? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been attending CPAC for multiple years now, the one before Trump was elected and every one since then. Every year, CPAC is both predictable and unpredictable. There\xe2\x80\x99s a predictable element, which is the conservative think-tank side, which is going to talk about stuff like energy production and think tanks. The unpredictable element is who\xe2\x80\x99s going to show up, which is always the more interesting story. This year has felt relatively calm, especially compared to last year. Last year, there was still a lot of animosity between people who were ushered in through the Trump era: The social media stars, blogs, publications that are popular with enthusiastic\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0Trump supporters who felt that they should have a seat at the table. There\xe2\x80\x99s still that separation, but it feels a little less standoffish. I also think because Republicans lost the House, they\xe2\x80\x99re feeling a little humbled. Last year, the tone was pretty extreme at times.\nAny weird run-ins? \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes people recognize me at this stuff because this is what I cover full-time instead of three days a year. Yesterday someone called me a Judeo Communist\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe7\xa5\xa2\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what that means; it was an anti-Semitic thing. Aside from a few bad actors, people are generally pretty polite here, and even random conference attendees, even if they aren\xe2\x80\x99t a fan of the work you do, they at least appreciate that you\xe2\x80\x99re interested. But because there are some bad actors, I definitely have to be situationally aware.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMolly Jong-Fast\n\xe2\x80\x94 Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) February 28, 2019\nOutlet:\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0The Bulwark\nYears on the right-wing beat: About one.\nHow does this CPAC compare to others? \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my first CPAC, and I\xe2\x80\x99m super excited to cover it for the Bulwark because they\xe2\x80\x99re the Never Trumpers. So they really get under people\xe2\x80\x99s skin in a way that other places don\xe2\x80\x99t. In fact yesterday someone was saying that Bill Kristol was the true enemy of Trump. So I think they are very focused on the Never Trumpers. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that last year was more nutty.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAny weird run-ins? \xe2\x80\x9cI was impressed; people have been really nice to me. Some people have recognized me. With other journalists, you definitely feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s a bond because there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain level of hostility towards journalists here. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve been treated nicely. I think in some way there are those fringey characters like Loomer, and it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to me to see that these people are so obsessed with media reporters. They have this fixation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCaleb Ecarma\njacob wohl is giving his cpac presser while flanked by a tiny security guard with a single airpod in his ear pic.twitter.com/tGt4vjI6oh\n\xe2\x80\x94 Caleb Ecarma (@calebecarma) February 28, 2019\nOutlet: Mediaite\nYears on the right-wing beat: Two-and-a-half.\nHow does this CPAC compare to others? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d say this year is more boring because you see less infighting than years past. For instance, when Ron Paul people were here in 2012 they walked in and were dressed differently and made a big stink. This year everyone\xe2\x80\x99s united against the left and socialism. I think under Trump it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten less exciting.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAny weird run-ins? As far as the Gorka thing (Ecarma had a viral altercation with conservative commentator Sebastian Gorka last year) people will come up to me and ask if I am the Gorka guy. Young conservative teens will come up and shake my hand and say, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s awesome.\xe2\x80\x9d So, I appreciate that sense of humor. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel unsafe. But with Laura Loomer, it shows how desperate the grift has gotten, following any reporter with ten thousand followers on Twitter just to badger them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it\xe2\x80\x99s just sad, and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cover it. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve been left alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGet Washingtonian\xe2\x80\x99s Daily DC Updates (Not Just Another Political News Roundup)\n'
