b"Add to Wishlist\nInstall\nPlay any visual novel that has been converted to VNDS or originally written in VNDS on your android!\nI developed this as an alternative to VNDS Interpreter which no longer seems to be supported by its developer. It is compatible with the VNDS format and I also extended the script commands to provide additional functionality (VNDS++).\nTo play a visual novel, it needs to be converted for VNDS. If there is some visual novel you'd like a converter (that currently does not exist), feel free to email me and I will see what I can do.\nInstructions:\n**FOR DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS AND WHERE TO GET CONVERTERS, SEE THE EXPLANATION VIDEO + DESCRIPTION**\n1. Acquire legal copy of the visual novel you want to play\n2. Find a converter that can convert it to VNDS\n3. Put the visual novel converted to VNDS-format somewhere in your device storage (preferably internal storage)\n4. Upon opening the app you will be prompted to select a visual novel directory. If you put it in your internal storage the app should be able to auto search for it, otherwise manually enter the path.\n5. You should now be taken to lobby screen where you can choose which novel to read.\nFunctionality:\n- Save. Create a checkpoint so you can continue where you left off.\n- Load. Premium feature. This way you can try it out to see whether you like it or not before purchasing.\n- Skip To Next Choice. Makes it easy to skip part of routes you have already read.\n- Text History. In case you missed something.\nRead more\n"
