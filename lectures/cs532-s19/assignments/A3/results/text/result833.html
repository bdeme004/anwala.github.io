b'6 Cheeses to Overindulge in When You\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e a SAD Cheese Slut\nFebruary 18, 2019\nby Krista Sheley 2 Comments\nBig Woods Blue with dark chocolate, 34 Degrees chocolate crisps, and Fat Toad Farm goat\xe2\x80\x99s milk caramel.\nNothing can cure seasonal depression the way cheese can. I strongly believe that pleasuring yourself with a sexy artisan wedge can be just as soothing and restorative as seeing your therapist. Since it\xe2\x80\x99s the height of SAD season, here\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 how to deal with that Vitamin D drop with ample dairy, as told by Cheese Sex Death intern Krista Sheley. Enjoy, my dear cheese sluts.- Erika\nAs a born and bred midwesterner and resident sad girl, I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb5e had some serious battles with SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) during these dark winter months. Now, I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa6 not saying you should eat your feelings but if you\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e under the weather, and it makes you feel better, go ahead and reach for that cheddar! Food policing is lame, and you don\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 need that kind of negativity right now. Besides, cheese contains a lot of Vitamin D (aka the Sunshine Vitamin) so it\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 basically medicine. Now let\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 unwrap some wedges and bite the block in the name of self-care, y\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x85\xaell.\nHere are 6 sexy cheeses to (over) indulge in when you\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e feeling like a SAD cheese slut.\n1. Big Woods Blue from Shepherds Way Farm\nSo you\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e feeling Blue, how about a buttery wedge of Big Woods Blue from Shepherds Way Farm in Minnesota? It\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 nice to have a little something sweet to tame the bitterness of depression, so get yourself a bar of dark chocolate to pair with this rich, nutty sheep\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 milk cheese. Studies show\xc2\xa0that chocolate with a cocoa content of at least 85% can\xc2\xa0 ease depression by helping your brain release feel-good serotonin. Even if you get a lighter cocoa, you\xe2\x80\x99re in for a mood boost because the combination of earthy blue and rich, dark chocolate is nothing short of orgasmic. Not a fan of the bitterness? Top off that duo with a caramel and pull out an extra set of panties, because you\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e gonna need them when that salty-sweetness hits your tongue!\n2. Alp Blossom from Sennerei Huban\nDuring these bleak, grey, days where the sun hides behind clouds and the trees are somber skeletons, I like to visit greenhouses and conservatories and invest in fresh flowers to remind myself that the winter will eventually end. This sexy Swiss has the same effect: Alp Blossom is a classic Alpine cheese covered in dried petals. This cheese is really damn good, boasting beefy flavors, notes of toasted walnut, and brown butter aromas with a supple, creamy finish. It\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 perfect for snacking on its own but it\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 also a real stunner on a cheese plate. Pair with a glass of ros\xef\xbe\x83\xef\xbd\xa9. You deserve it.\n3. American Cheese \xef\xbe\x82\xef\xbd\xaf\\_(\xe7\xb9\x9d)_/\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xbd\xaf\nFor this next cheese, drop your pitchforks, suspend all disbelief and hear me out, because I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa6 talking about American Cheese. Yes, the processed, sliced cheese that I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa6 willing to bet holds childhood memories for most of us. Nostalgia is a powerful thing, and sometimes it can help loosen the grip of winter depression, at least for the duration of a grilled cheese sandwich or cheeseburger. Let its artificial golden coloring transport you to the summer backyard barbecues of yore, and try to take things a little less seriously for a moment.\n4. 5-Year Cheddar from Face Rock Creamery\nCan\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 quite get down with the Singles? Cheddar also pulls at the heartstrings. Aged varieties have a more intense flavor and crumbly, crunchy texture. One of my personal favorites is Face Rock \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 5 Year Cheddar, which is bursting with seductive notes of fresh grass and that classic cheddar tang that always makes my mouth water. Pair with some roasted grapes, or melt atop a slice of warm apple pie, because \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\x97n apple pie without the cheese is like a kiss without the squeeze.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nBaked\n5. Baked Brie\nSometimes misery loves company, and that\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 when you want a cheese as sad and weepy as you are, like a classic baked brie. There\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 no limit to the number of pairings that go along with a warmed and oozing brie, so let your imagination run wild with this one. During the winter, I like to top mine with candied walnuts, honey, and some fresh herbs. Walnuts are full of omega-3 fatty acids, which help with brain function . Add it to that gooey wheel and you\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e in for an intensely sensual, sinful experience that\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa4l lift you right out of that forlorn funk.\n6. Midnight Moon from Cypress Grove\nIf you can\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 beat \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe8\x84\x87m join \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe8\x84\x87m. As most goths worth their black salt know, sometimes it\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 cathartic to embrace the dark half of the year. Dim the lights, draw the curtains, light some candles, sit with your feelings, and center yourself. While you\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e self-examining, it\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 nice to have something dependable to fall back on like gouda. Midnight Moon from Cypress Grove is a goat\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 milk gouda, with a comforting brown butter flavor, dense richness, and crunchy crystals that\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa4l bring you back to the first time you listened to Sisters of Mercy. Pair with a malty beer, and indulge by candlelight.\nShare this:\n'
