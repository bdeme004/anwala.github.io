But even though both sides have toned down their fiery threats and begun nuclear disarmament talks, the attacks persist.\nIn 2017, Mr. Trump mocked Kim Jong-un as \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xa8ocket man\xe7\xaa\xb6 in a speech at the United Nations, while North Korea tested missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the United States. The attacks began soon after that. Though the two sides failed to reach an agreement last week, Mr. Trump struck a conciliatory tone toward his North Korean counterpart.\nThe revelation of North Korea\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 most recent hacking activity adds new details to the tensions surrounding the summit meeting last week, which ended abruptly without any deals. After their first meeting, about eight months earlier, North Korea had agreed to stop test-firing its missiles.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa1or 15 months, they haven\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 tested weapons because of this negotiation but over those same 15 months they have not stopped their cyber activity,\xe7\xaa\xb6 said Victor Cha, the Korea chairman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nWith the help of an unnamed foreign law enforcement agency, the McAfee researchers gained access to one of the main computer servers used by the North Korean hackers to stage their attacks.\nThe McAfee researchers said they watched, in real time, as the North Koreans attacked the computer networks of more than a hundred companies in the United States and around the globe. Last month, they expanded their targets to companies in Turkey, operating from a block of internet addresses traced to Namibia, one of the few countries that still maintains friendly relations with Pyongyang.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhey are very, very, very active. It\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 been nonstop,\xe7\xaa\xb6 said Raj Samani, McAfee\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 chief scientist. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9e\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb5e seen them hit in excess of 100 victims.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nThe exact motive of the attacks was not clear. They were well-researched and highly focused and, in many cases, aimed at engineers and executives who had broad access to their companies\xe7\xaa\xb6 computer networks and intellectual property.\nMcAfee, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., would not name the targets of the attacks and said it would make its finding public Sunday. But the firm did provide a map of North Korean hackers\xe7\xaa\xb6 targets.\nThe vast majority were in the United States, with the most frequent marks in Houston, an oil and gas hub, and New York, a finance hub. Other major targets included London, Madrid, Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Rome, Bangkok, Taipei, Seoul and Hong Kong. Russia and mainland China, two countries that have maintained cordial relations with North Korea, were relatively untouched.\nVideo\nDespite the devastation cyberweapons have caused around the world over the last decade, they are still in their infancy. David E. Sanger, a New York Times national security correspondent, explains why the threat is growing.CreditCreditIllustration by Aaron Byrd\nNorth Korea, like the United States and many other countries, has long been accused of using hackers to further its national interests. In 2014, apparently in retaliation for a movie that mocked Mr. Kim, North Korean hackers hit Sony Pictures Entertainment. They destroyed Sony\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 computer servers, paralyzed the studio\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 operations and eventually leaked embarrassing emails from executives, in what would become a playbook for the Russian attacks and leaks of emails ahead of the 2016 elections.\nNorth Korean hackers have been tied to attacks on banks all around the world for financial gain \xe7\xaa\xb6 a rarity among government-affiliated hackers but not surprising for a country ravaged by economic sanctions. The \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9annaCry\xe7\xaa\xb6 attack, which paralyzed more than 150 organizations around the globe in 2017 , was also traced to North Korea.\nMr. Cha, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said cyberattacks remained the \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xbchird leg\xe7\xaa\xb6 of North Korea\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 overall military strategy. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhey\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e never going to compete with the United States and South Korea soldier to soldier, tank for tank,\xe7\xaa\xb6 he said. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\x9co they have moved to an asymmetric strategy of nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and the third leg is cyber, that we really didn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 become aware of until Sony.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nSince the Sony attack, McAfee\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 researchers said North Korea\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 hackers had significantly improved their capabilities: They are much better at hiding their tracks and researching their targets. And in many of the attacks McAfee witnessed, North Korean hackers had done their homework.\nThey scoured the Microsoft-owned business site LinkedIn, for example, to find the profiles of industry job recruiters. They sent emails that appeared to come from those recruiters\xe7\xaa\xb6 accounts, often in perfect English, promoting job opportunities.\nWhen a target clicked on an attachment or link in the email, the hackers gained access to the target\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 computer.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhe campaign was clearly really well prepared,\xe7\xaa\xb6 said Christiaan Beek, McAfee\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 senior principal engineer and lead scientist. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xact was very well researched and very targeted. They knew the individuals they were going for, and they drafted emails in such a way that their targets clicked on them.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nThe tools they used to implant malware in the recent attacks, which McAfee\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 researchers called \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\x9dising Sun\xe7\xaa\xb6 because of a reference in the code, were also starkly improved.\nThough the implants shared code with previous North Korean attacks, McAfee\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 researchers said the hackers added new functions to lift data off infected machines. They also went to great lengths to delete their digital movements and encrypt their traffic.\nMr. Beek and Mr. Samani said their team at McAfee was able to follow the hackers\xe7\xaa\xb6 movements only because of their access to the North Koreans\xe7\xaa\xb6 server. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhe more code we saw, the more links we could see to more and more attacks,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Mr. Beek said.\nConsidering other recent North Korean hacking campaigns that McAfee\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 researchers have tracked \xe7\xaa\xb6 notably against the 2018 Winter Olympics and a separate spate of attacks on banks last year \xe7\xaa\xb6 Mr. Beek said North Korea showed no signs of slowing this activity.\nSecurity experts said the attacks would have to be addressed at some point if the two countries should continue talks.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bheir very aggressive cyberactivity will have to be addressed in future discussions,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Mr. Cha said. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhey are extremely active and, it\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 clear to me at least, they\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb5e stopped missile testing because of the ongoing negotiations, but they\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e not stopping in cyber.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nCorrection:\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0\nMarch 5, 2019\nBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the length of time between the first and second summit meetings between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, North Korea\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 leader. It was about eight months, not 15.\nFollow Nicole Perlroth on Twitter: @nicoleperlroth\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: North Korea Hacked U.S. During Talks.
