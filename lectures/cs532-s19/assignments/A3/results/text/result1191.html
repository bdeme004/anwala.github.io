b'- World\nAnthony Weiner Leaves Federal Prison For A Re-entry Center In Brooklyn\nFormer Congressman, Anthony Weiner has been released from prison and is now part of a re-entry program awaiting\nhis full release in May.\nWeiner, who was sentenced to 21- months in prison, was to be released on May 14th this year. However, the authorities say that he left earlier than the set date because he was at his best behavior while in prison. The 54-year-old Democrat was transferred from Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Medical Center into a residential re-entry program in New York on an undisclosed date.\nWeiner was convicted in 2017 for sending sexually explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl from North Carolina. He began serving time in November of the same year.\nWeiner was a prominent figure in the Democratic party, serving nearly 12 years in Congress. His political career and reputation began to sink when he sent a suggestive personal photo to a college student via Twitter in 2011.\nAt first, the New York Democrat claimed that his account was hacked but he later admitted to having inappropriate interactions with different women on social media. At the time, Weiner was married to Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s top aide. He eventually resigned from Congress after his indecent behavior became public knowledge.\nIn 2013, Weiner attempted to revive his political career by running for the office of New York City mayor. His improper behavior, again, came to limelight after it was discovered that he had sexted at least one woman under the alias \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\x9aarlos Danger\xe7\xaa\xb6 after his resignation from Congress. He was unable to get up to 5% of the vote in the Democratic primaries.\nIn 2017, when Weiner pleaded guilty to sending series of immoral messages to a minor in North Carolina, he told the court that his sex addiction had made him a very sick man for a long time. His attorney said that the former lawmaker had probably sent and received thousands of messages from hundreds of women over the years. He was exchanging messages with at least 19 women when he met the teenager.\nPost navigation\nFacebook Called \xe2\x80\x98Digital Gangsters\xe2\x80\x99 in Fake News Report\nAbout Alice Clarke\nI am a freelance journalist, producer and writer.
