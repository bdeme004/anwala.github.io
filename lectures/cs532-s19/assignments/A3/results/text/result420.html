A similar bill introduced last year was defeated by Republicans, who held the majority in the Colorado Senate. This year could be different as the House, Senate and Governor\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 office are controlled by Democrats.\nThe bill is sponsored by freshman Rep. Tom Sullivan, (D) of Centennial. He lost his son Alex in the 2012 Aurora theater shooting. He was joined by House Majority Leader Rep. Alec Garnett, (D) Denver, Sen. Lois Court, (D) Denver, and Sen. Brittany Pettersen, (D) Lakewood.\nSheriffs around the state came out on both sides of the bill during the debate. Some said they believe it would be good for public safety, especially in cases of domestic violence. Others expressed concerns about seizing guns from otherwise innocent people, with no due process.\nDouglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock is among the supporters of the measure.\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell, El Paso County Sheriff Bill Elder, and Weld County Sheriff Reams\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0have voiced opposition to the bill.\nThis week the county commissioners for Fremont and Custer County have passed resolutions declaring their jurisdictions as Second Amendment Sanctuaries.\nRocky Mountain Gun Owners \xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0has come out against the bill, declaring it will \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xado nothing to prevent another Columbine, Aurora, or Parkland.\xe7\xaa\xb6 The group condemns the legislation stating it is \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xadesigned to strip gun owners of their lawfully owned property, without due process, violating both their Second and Fifth Amendment rights,\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe6\x95\x96\xef\xa3\xb0says RMGO Executive Director Dudley Brown.\nThe Custer County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office posted the following on their Facebook page this afternoon:\nThe bill as currently written is in direct conflict with provisions of Due Process, as outlined in the 4th Amendment, and contradict the right to bear arms. This Resolution reinforces the US Supreme Courts affirmation of citizens Rights under the 2nd Amendment. We are thankful to our commissioners for taking a strong position for the citizens of Custer County.\nRELATED:\n'
