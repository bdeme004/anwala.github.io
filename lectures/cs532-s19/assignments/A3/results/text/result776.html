b"And why we can't live without it\nPerfect Thing\nWild One Makes Genius Dog Leashes\nEasy to clean and functional to boot\nFeb 27, 2019\nEasy to clean and functional to boot\nI\xe2\x80\x99m constantly taking my dog, Koda, on hikes. While we work on his off-leash skills, our time outside happens with him tethered to me. This presents a lot of obstacles, the largest of which is finding the right leash for both of us. I want something that will hold up to wear and tear,\xc2\xa0but won\xe2\x80\x99t give me rope burn if Koda, who weighs 60 pounds, suddenly pulls. It also needs to be long enough to let my dog explore,\xc2\xa0but short enough that he can\xe2\x80\x99t weave out of control. A leash from Wild One ($75) answered all my dog-mom concerns and then some.\nWhat first caught my eye about the Wild One lead is the material. After being tied to picnic tables at muddy campgrounds and carried around in dust and snow, my dog\xe2\x80\x99s rope leashes all end up a dull gray color with fraying threads. This one is made of flex-poly coated nylon, which looks and feels like rubber. That makes it easy to clean (a quick rinse under warm water has it looking like new) and ensures that it\xe2\x80\x99ll hold up to wear and tear.\n(Emily Reed)\nBeyond that, you form the handle loop by clipping the leash to itself, which allows you to quickly tie your dog to a pole or tree (a lifesaver at campgrounds), and you can adjust the length to 5.5 feet in open spaces or 3.25 feet if you need a shorter lead, like in a crowded area. Best of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable on the skin even with your dog yanking at full force. (I tested this at White Sands National Monument, where Koda was excitedly running up sand dunes while I slogged behind him\xe2\x80\x94no pain or digging whatsoever.)\nAt $75, this leash is on the pricey end of dog gear. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for one leash that can get dragged through mud and pulled along trails and come out looking (and working) like new, this is it.\n"
