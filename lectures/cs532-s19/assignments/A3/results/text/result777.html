b"Country\nDear Committee,\nThere are few things more important than protecting children from sexual abuse. That's why  I fully support the international ban on child pornography, in the form that it exists now: a ban on images and videos of real children being abused.\nI do not support the proposed extension of the definition to include drawings, cartoons, written materials, toys, or other representations of imaginary or fictional children, as proposed in the current draft Guidelines on the implementation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.\nThere is no evidence that representations of imaginary or fictional children results in harm to real children. Therefore, banning such representations would infringe the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nPlease ensure that no recommendation that state parties censor or criminalize artistic or literary representations of imaginary or fictional children is included in the final Guidelines.\n**your signature**\nAdd me to your mailing list\nBCC yourself\n"
