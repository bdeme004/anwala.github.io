So the anti-immigrant piece coupled with things that he said, the kind of people who supported him, former Ku Klux Klan members and the like, the message that we called the dogwhistle, was incredibly loud. It was: \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe9\x9c\xb2\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa6 on your side because I don\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 like the same people you don\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 like.
