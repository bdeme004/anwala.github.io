REUTERS/Asif Shahzad\nISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan plans to lodge a complaint against India at the United Nations, accusing it of \xe2\x80\x9ceco-terrorism\xe2\x80\x9d over air strikes that damaged pine trees and brought the nuclear-armed nations to blows, a government minister said on Friday.\nIndia and Pakistan are amidst their biggest stand-off in many years, with the United States and other global powers mediating to de-escalate tensions between arch-foes who have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947.\nIndian warplanes on Tuesday bombed a hilly forest area near the northern Pakistani town of Balakot, about 40 km (25 miles)  from India\xe2\x80\x99s border in the Himalayan region of Kashmir. New Delhi said it had destroyed a militant training camp and killed hundreds of \xe2\x80\x9cterrorists\xe2\x80\x9d.\nPakistan denied there were any such camps in the area and locals said only one elderly villager was hurt.\nClimate Change Minister Malik Amin Aslam said Indian jets bombed a \xe2\x80\x9cforest reserve\xe2\x80\x9d and the government was undertaking an environmental impact assessment, which will be the basis a complaint at the United Nations and other forums.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened over there is environmental terrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d Aslam told Reuters, adding that dozens of pine trees had been felled. \xe2\x80\x9cThere has been serious environmental damage.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTwo Reuters reporters who visited the site of the bombings, where four large craters could be seen, said up to 15 pine trees had been brought down by the blasts. Villagers dismissed Indian claims that hundreds of militants were killed.\nThe United Nations states that \xe2\x80\x9cdestruction of the environment, not justified by military necessity and carried out wantonly, is clearly contrary to existing international law\xe2\x80\x9d, according to the U.N. General Assembly resolution 47/37.\nIndia and Pakistan are also engaged in a diplomatic tussle, with New Delhi vowing to isolate Pakistan over its alleged links to militant groups. Islamabad is currently putting pressure on the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to uninvite India\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister from their next meeting.\nReporting by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Nick Macfie\n"
