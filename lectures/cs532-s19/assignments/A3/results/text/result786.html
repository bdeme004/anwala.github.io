Orlando Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith and Miami-area Rep. Michael Grieco this week introduced HB 1117 which would legalize recreational marijuana in Florida. Grieco also introduced HB 1119 which would impose an excise tax on recreational marijuana. The first bill would allow people 21 and older to purchase and use limited amounts of marijuana in private. Smoking marijuana in public would result in a fine under the bill. The bill would create a path to full access to cannabis in Florida and a structure for its cultivation, sale, and taxation, a press release from Grieco\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 office said. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\x9aontinuing to criminalize responsible adult use of cannabis just doesn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 make any sense. There\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 no reason cannabis can\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 be regulated in ways similar to alcohol,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Gueillermo Smith said. HB 1119 would tax the sale of recreational marijuana. The bill will likely face an uphill battle as lawmakers have only been cautiously moving forward with repealing a ban on smokable medical marijuana. Responding to an ultimatum issued by Gov. Ron DeSantis, lawmakers are almost certain to repeal Florida\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 ban on smoking medical marijuana. If they don\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 act by March 15, the Republican governor has threatened to drop the state\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 appeal of a court ruling that said the ban runs afoul of the 2016 constitutional amendment.Over the past month, House and Senate leaders have drawn closer to reaching consensus on a repeal, but two differences remain.The House proposal (HB 7015) would allow dispensaries to sell pre-rolled marijuana cigarettes, but smoking would be off-limits to patients under age 18.\nORLANDO, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94\nA Central Florida lawmaker is one of two Democrats who has introduced legislation aimed at legalizing recreational marijuana in Florida.\nOrlando Rep.
