b'Buffy the Vampire Slayer Returns to High School in New Comic Books\n2 \xef\xbd\xb0\xe6\x87\x8d\xe5\xb0\x8d ago admin\nHigh school can be hell and no one knows that better than Buffy the Vampire Slayer, who returns to her teenage roots in a new comic book series from Boom! Studios that arrives in stores on Wednesday.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\x9duffy,\xe7\xaa\xb6 written by Jordie Bellaire , illustrated by Dan Mora , colored by Ra\xef\xbe\x83\xef\xbd\xbal Angulo and lettered by Ed Dukeshire , reboots the character and her friends and resets them to their high school days \xe7\xaa\xb6 in contemporary times, not 1997, when her television series debuted . (The show ran for seven seasons and later explored her college years.)\nImage\nXander and Willow watch Buffy confront a monster, who mocks her for working at the fast-food restaurant Tunaverse.CreditBoom! Studios\nThere was also a take by Dark Horse, which published comics from 2007 to 2018 that envisioned what Seasons 8 through 12 would have been like if the show had continued. Joss Whedon, who wrote the \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\x9duffy the Vampire Slayer\xe7\xaa\xb6 film that was released in 1992 and created the TV series, serves as a story consultant for the comics.\nJeanine Schaefer edits the new series. She recruited Bellaire for the book thanks in part to her work on Redlands, about a coven of witches in a small Florida town. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xact felt like the exact right mix of talking about identity issues, gender issues and still having that thread of horror and so moments of levity,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Schaefer said during a conference call with Bellaire.\nTerror and humor resonate for many as an apt description of high school, including for Bellaire. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xb4e and Jeanine talked about how teenagers now are growing up a bit different than they did in the \xe7\xaa\xb690s,\xe7\xaa\xb6 she said. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xact is a trying time for teenagers. I think people are feeling a lot of pressure and negativity.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nPrevious adventures will not be rehashed in the reboot, which will take all new stories. The setting allows some of the characters to begin at a new point. While Willow, for example, eventually came out as a lesbian on the TV series, she is already open about her orientation in Issue No. 1 of the new comic. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhe \xe7\xaa\xb690s was a different time on TV and for the L.G.B.T. community,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Bellaire said. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xac\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x9b\x98 like to think it is a little more open now,\xe7\xaa\xb6 allowing Willow to be much more confident.\nRelated Posts:\nA New Comics Publisher Aims to Shake Things Up\nCBS Paid the Actress Eliza Dushku $9.5 Million to\xe2\x80\xa6\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe6\xa6\x94assage\xe7\xaa\xb6 and \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe9\xad\xafiscovery\xe7\xaa\xb6 vampires have very different bites\nReview: In \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe7\x8b\xbche Passage,\xe7\xaa\xb6 the Bloodsuckers Are\xe2\x80\xa6\nContinue Reading\n'
