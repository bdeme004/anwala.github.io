b'January 16, 2016 | 8:59pm\nPost photo composite\nAs polls tighten and self-described socialist Bernie Sanders looks more like a serious contender than a novelty candidate for president, the liberal media elite have suddenly stopped calling him socialist. He\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 now cleaned up as a \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x98rogressive\xe7\xaa\xb6 or \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x98ragmatist.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nBut he\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 not even a socialist. He\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 a communist.\nMainstreaming Sanders requires whitewashing his radical pro-communist past. It won\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 be easy to do.\nIf Sanders were vying for a Cabinet post, he\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x9b\x98 never pass an FBI background check. There\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x9b\x98 be too many subversive red flags popping up in his file. He was a communist collaborator during the height of the Cold War.\nRewind to 1964.\nWhile attending the University of Chicago, Sanders joined the Young People\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 Socialist League, the youth wing of the Socialist Party USA. He also organized for a communist front, the United Packinghouse Workers Union, which at the time was under investigation by the House Committee on Un-American Activities.\nAfter graduating with a political science degree, Sanders moved to Vermont, where he headed the American People\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 History Society, an organ for Marxist propaganda. There, he produced a glowing documentary on the life of socialist revolutionary Eugene Debs, who was jailed for espionage during the Red Scare and hailed by the Bolsheviks as \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa3merica\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 greatest Marxist.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nReuters\nThis subversive hero of Sanders, denounced even by liberal Democrats as a \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xbcraitor,\xe7\xaa\xb6 bashed \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xbche barons of Wall Street\xe7\xaa\xb6 and hailed the \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xbcriumphant\xe7\xaa\xb6 Bolshevik revolution in Russia.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhose Russian comrades of ours have made greater sacrifices, have suffered more, and have shed more heroic blood than any like number of men and women anywhere on Earth,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Debs proclaimed. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhey have laid the foundation of the first real democracy that ever drew the breath of life in this world.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nIn a 1918 speech in Canton, Ohio, Debs reaffirmed his solidarity with Lenin and Trotsky, despite clear evidence of their violent plunder and treachery.\nSanders still hangs a portrait of Debs on the wall in his Senate office.\nIn the early \xe7\xaa\xb670s, Sanders helped found the Liberty Union Party, which called for the nationalization of all US banks and the public takeover of all private utility companies.\nMainstreaming Sanders requires whitewashing his radical pro-communist past. It won\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 be easy to do.\nAfter failed runs for Congress, Sanders in 1981 managed to get elected mayor of Burlington, Vt., where he restricted property rights for landlords, set price controls and raised property taxes to pay for communal land trusts. Local small businesses distributed fliers complaining their new mayor \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xadoes not believe in free enterprise.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nHis radical activities didn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 stop at the \xef\xbe\x82\xef\xbd\xadwater\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 edge.\nSanders took several \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x83oodwill\xe7\xaa\xb6 trips not only to the USSR, but also to Cuba and Nicaragua, where the Soviets were trying to expand their influence in our hemisphere.\nIn 1985, he traveled to Managua to celebrate the rise to power of the Marxist-Leninist Sandinista government. He called it a \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x82eroic revolution.\xe7\xaa\xb6 Undermining anti-communist US policy, Sanders denounced the Reagan administration\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 backing of the Contra rebels in a letter to the Sandinistas.\nHis betrayal did not end there. Sanders lobbied the White House to stop the proxy war and even tried to broker a peace deal. He adopted Managua as a sister city and invited Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega to visit the US. He exalted Ortega as \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\x97n impressive guy,\xe7\xaa\xb6 while attacking President Reagan.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhe Sandinista government has more support among the Nicaraguan people \xe7\xaa\xb6 substantially more support \xe7\xaa\xb6 than Ronald Reagan has among the American people,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Sanders told Vermont government-access TV in 1985.\nAP\nSanders also adopted a Soviet sister city outside Moscow and honeymooned with his second wife in the USSR. He put up a Soviet flag in his office, shocking even the Birkenstock-wearing local liberals. At the time, the Evil Empire was on the march around the world, and threatening the US with nuclear annihilation.\nThen, in 1989, as the West was on the verge of winning the Cold War, Sanders addressed the national conference of the US Peace Council \xe7\xaa\xb6 a known front for the Communist Party USA, whose members swore an oath not only to the Soviet Union but to \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xbche triumph of Soviet power in the US.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nToday, Sanders wants to bring what he admired in the USSR, Cuba, Nicaragua and other communist states to America.\nFor starters, he proposes completely nationalizing our health care system and putting private health insurance and drug companies \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x99ut of business.\xe7\xaa\xb6 He also wants to break up \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\x99ig banks\xe7\xaa\xb6 and control the energy industry, while providing \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xb7ree\xe7\xaa\xb6 college tuition, a \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x91iving wage\xe7\xaa\xb6 and guaranteed homeownership and jobs through massive public works projects. Price tag: $18 trillion.\nWho will pay for it all? You will. Sanders plans to not only soak the rich with a 90 percent-plus tax rate, while charging Wall Street a \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xadpeculation tax,\xe7\xaa\xb6 but hit every American with a \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x83lobal-warming tax.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nOf course, even that wouldn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 cover the cost of his communist schemes; a President Sanders would eventually soak the middle class he claims to champion. From each according to his ability, to each according to his need, right?\nComrade from Vermont\nFormer mayoral advisers from Burlington defend their old boss. They note that Sanders was never a member of the Communist Party and deny he was even a small-c communist, even while acknowledging he named their city softball squad the \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x83eople\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 Republic of Burlington\xe7\xaa\xb6 and the town\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 minor league baseball team the \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x96ermont Reds.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nWhat about those communist sister cities he adopted? \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\x9dernie established them to support people-to-people exchanges which might support peace in the long run,\xe7\xaa\xb6 said Bruce \xef\xbe\x82\xef\xbd\xadSeifer, who was one of Sanders\xe7\xaa\xb6 central economic planners directing Burlington businesses to \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xa8einvest their profits in the community.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nIn an interview, Seifer claimed that it was \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x9eo different than President Nixon opening relations with China.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nPlease. Sanders and his Sanderistas are all still pining for what Debs called \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xbche Greater Revolution yet to come.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nWhat\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 revolting is how this hardcore commie\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 campaign has gotten this far. With his ascendancy in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders is no longer just a fool; he\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 now a dangerous fool.\nWhile it may be hard to hate the old codger, it\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 easy \xe7\xaa\xb6 and virtuous \xe7\xaa\xb6 to hate his un-American ideas. They should be swept into the dustbin with the rest of communist history.\nPaul Sperry is a visiting Hoover Institution media fellow and author of \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhe Great American Bank Robbery,\xe7\xaa\xb6 which exposes progressive policies behind the mortgage bust.
