b'Trump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 failure in Vietnam is a reminder of the merits of the Iran deal\n(Luong Thai Linh/EPA-EFE)\nPresident Trump has precious little to show after a few days of photo-ops and glad-handing in Hanoi. On Thursday, the American delegation pulled out of talks with their North Korean counterparts with no new agreement in sight and no clear plans for a future top-level summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump cited North Korean demands for complete sanctions relief as the reason he chose to \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbf\xa4alk away,\xe7\xaa\xb6 while the North Koreans offered a different version of events . Whatever the case, the president tried to spin the developments positively.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xac think everybody hoped we could do this better, but the departure was with an agreement we continue to work on what has been an incredibly difficult problem,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Trump told reporters . \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa2veryone walked away in that spirit.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nTrump has put himself at the center of the diplomatic efforts to curb the North Korean nuclear program and potentially end a decades-long frozen conflict on the Korean Peninsula. After spending his first months in office insulting Kim and threatening North Korea with \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xb7ire and fury,\xe7\xaa\xb6 he dramatically changed his pitch as contacts with Pyongyang grew, and he now speaks warmly of a budding friendship between him and one of the world\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 last remaining totalitarian despots.\nBut experts warned that no amount of personal chemistry can compensate for inadequate preparation. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhe failure was an admission of a need for more time and working-level talks to achieve an agreement,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Scott Snyder, a Korea expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, told The Washington Post .\nAs my colleagues noted , the summit\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 abrupt end doomed Trump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 prediction that his sit-down with Kim would be \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xb3qual or greater\xe7\xaa\xb6 than their meeting last year in Singapore. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xact also raises doubts about whether the two sides can regain momentum in a high-stakes negotiation that has yet to achieve results from lower-level diplomats working behind the scenes,\xe7\xaa\xb6 wrote The Post\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 John Hudson and Simon Denyer . \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xacn the absence of progress on the diplomatic front, experts worry that tensions could rise on the military front.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nWith Trump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 exit, the task of reviving the process with Pyongyang falls to his lieutenants. But that\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 arguably where the problems began. In the buildup to the summit, it became clear that key Trump officials were at odds with each other over the way forward. National security adviser John Bolton, a skeptic of rapprochement with Pyongyang, voiced his disquiet with Stephen Biegun, Trump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 special envoy to North Korea, whom Bolton and other like-minded officials feared was moving too quickly to make a deal with the Kim regime.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xb8ou aren\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 ready for a summit if your secretary of state, national security adviser, special envoy to the talks and the president aren\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 all singing from one sheet of music,\xe7\xaa\xb6 said Richard Nephew, a scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.\nNephew knows a thing or two about forging nuclear deals. He served in the Obama administration and was the lead sanctions expert in the American negotiating team that helped broker the agreement between Iran and world powers in 2015. Trump repeatedly panned that deal as naive and ineffective and then undermined it by reimposing on the Iranians sanctions that had been lifted under Obama in return for severe restrictions on Tehran\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 nuclear facilities.\nBut Nephew and the Iran deal\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 other defenders point to the years of diligent, painstaking diplomatic legwork required to achieve what U.N. monitors and the U.S. intelligence community still say is as an effective arms control pact. And they set that against the flimsiness of what Trump has achieved so far with North Korea.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhe contrast couldn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 be more stark,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Nephew told Today\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 WorldView. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9e spent literally months when we weren\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 negotiating going over different options, strategizing, working with partners, making sure [administration officials] were all on the same page and all speaking with the same words when we spoke in public. We approached this as a serious, grown-up negotiation.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nWhen reckoning with North Korea, the Trump administration has struggled even to agree internally on what \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xadenuclearization\xe7\xaa\xb6 looks like. While Obama stayed out of the various rounds of negotiations between U.S., European and Iranian officials, Trump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 rush to personalize the process gave Kim a theatrical pas de deux with the American president, and proof that Pyongyang\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 covert pursuit and possession of a nuclear arsenal was the right ticket to legitimacy on the world stage.\nTrump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 lack of strategic preparation also created headaches for key U.S. allies in the region \xe7\xaa\xb6 unsettling a Japanese government wary of North Korean duplicity, and now embarrassing a dovish South Korean government that had been banking on a meaningful agreement to emerge from Hanoi.\nThe one actual document signed by Kim and Trump \xe7\xaa\xb6 a short declaration following the Singapore summit \xe7\xaa\xb6 makes the Iran deal \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x91ook like a model of clarity and specificity,\xe7\xaa\xb6 noted Joshua Stanton, a veteran commentator on North Korea . \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa1or all its flaws, [the Iran deal] undeniably gained us something. .\xe7\xaa\xb6.\xe7\xaa\xb6. [I]t got Iran to surrender a big stockpile of enriched uranium and make some useful concessions that would slow (but not stop) its path to a nuclear bomb.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nThe Iran deal\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 opponents, including Trump, argue that the agreement did nothing to rein in Tehran\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 other destabilizing behavior in the Middle East. But the Trump administration has hardly yoked North Korea\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 own problematic actions abroad \xe7\xaa\xb6 from targeted assassinations to the sale of chemical weapons material to countries in the Middle East and Africa, outlined in a leaked confidential U.N. report \xe7\xaa\xb6 to the diplomatic process.\nThe double standard irks former Obama administration officials. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9e all agree that in an ideal world, we would have addressed not just the nuclear threat, but all the threats,\xe7\xaa\xb6 said Susan E. Rice, who served as a national security adviser in the Obama White House, at a Wednesday event hosted by Georgetown University. But that, she added, was \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x9eot the aim\xe7\xaa\xb6 of the negotiations with Tehran.\nInstead, the United States and its allies managed \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xbco take a very proximate, specific and, some would say, existential threat off the table,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Rice said. Even after the Trump administration has scrapped Washington\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 end of the bargain with Iran, Rice noted that \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbf\xa4e are not getting any more traction on the other threats now than before.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nAnd a hypothetical future interim agreement with North Korea, Rice said, wouldn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 deliver \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\x97 fraction of what we got with the Iranians."\nThe irony of the moment, said Robert Litwak of the Woodrow Wilson Center to the New York Times , \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xbfs that the best possible outcome for North Korea would look something like the Iran deal.\xe7\xaa\xb6\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xef\xbd\xa2 My colleagues delve into the disagreements between the United States and North Korea\xc2\xa0that brought the talks to an end :\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhe fundamental disagreements rested on the trade-offs between the United States providing relief from sanctions and North Korea\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons program\xe7\xaa\xb6\xef\xbd\xa6\n"Trump said the main impediment to a deal was Kim\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 requirement that the United States lift all economic sanctions on North Korea in exchange for the closure of only one\xc2\xa0nuclear facility, which still would have left Pyongyang with a large arsenal of missiles and warheads.\n"But Trump also raised concerns about North Korea\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 concealment of parts of its nuclear industry.\n"Hours later, North Korea\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, offered a slightly different take at a rare news conference, arguing that Kim\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 regime sought only \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe6\xb9\xbeartial\xe7\xaa\xb6 sanctions relief in return for dismantling the North\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 main enrichment capabilities for fissile material.\n"In a separate news conference, North Korea\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 vice foreign minister, Choe Son Hui, suggested Kim had \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe8\xa9\xabost the will to engage in dealmaking\xe7\xaa\xb6 as the talks unraveled. The United States, she said, was missing a\xc2\xa0\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe6\xa4\x80nce-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\xe7\xaa\xb6 and she said no future meetings between the two sides were planned.\xe7\xaa\xb6\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xef\xbd\xa2 And here is more on how Japan and South Korea reacted to the conclusion of the Hanoi summit :\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xbeutside the United States, Japanese officials have long preferred a more hawkish posture toward the North Koreans and are expected to be relieved that Trump did not trade sanctions relief for the shutdown of North Korea\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 Yongbyon nuclear facility, an expansive compound that houses the country\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 uranium-enrichment facilities but does not encompass the entirety of the North\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 warheads and missile inventory. On Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe backed Trump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 decision and said he \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xadid not compromise easily.\xe7\xaa\xb6\n"But America\'s other key Asian ally, South Korean President Moon Jae-in, has invested a huge amount of his personal prestige in engagement with North Korea. He is certain to be enormously disappointed in the breakdown of the talks.\n"Presidential spokesman Kim Eui-keum called it \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xa8egrettable\xe7\xaa\xb6 that Trump and Kim Jong Un were not able to reach \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xa1omplete agreement\xe7\xaa\xb6 at the talks, and he expressed hope that the two sides would continue to talk. But a South Korean presidential adviser offered a franker assessment of Thursday\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 events\xe7\xaa\xb6\xef\xbd\xa6\n"Moon had talked grandly of establishing road and rail links with North Korea as a first step toward the sort of economic integration that Europe established after World War II. He has also been keen to restart a joint economic zone in Kaesong in North Korea that was closed in 2016 during North Korea\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 nuclear and missile testing, as well as a joint tourism project at Mount Kumgang.\xe7\xaa\xb6\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xef\xbd\xa2 President Trump found other ways to court controversy. At a press conference before leaving Hanoi, he claimed to believe that Kim was not responsible for the death of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who was arrested and imprisoned in North Korea and would eventually die after mistreatment in detention. The Post\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 Eugene Scott argues this is part of a wider theme of Trump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 presidency :\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9hen given the opportunity to stand up to some of the world\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 most notorious authoritarians, Trump has chosen to give them the benefit of the doubt despite history, news reports and experts telling him otherwise.\n"The president:\n"\xe7\xab\x99 Expressed confidence in Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose government is accused of a\xc2\xa0 long list \xc2\xa0of human rights violations. Trump said he believed Putin\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 claims that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n"\xe7\xab\x99 Praised Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for doing an \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbf\x96nbelievable job\xe7\xaa\xb6 fighting illegal drug use, even as reporters documented that Duterte\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 law enforcement has played a role in thousands of extrajudicial killings in the drug war.\n"\xe7\xab\x99 Has stood by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite evidence suggesting that he ordered the brutal murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\xe7\xaa\xb6\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xef\xbd\xa2 By the time you read this,\xc2\xa0Pakistan may have already released an Indian fighter pilot it captured Wednesday.\xc2\xa0If the repatriation happens, it should\xc2\xa0ease\xc2\xa0the immediate risk of further conflict between India and Pakistan after the two nuclear-armed rivals engaged their most dangerous military encounter in decades .\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xef\xbd\xa2 Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\xef\xbe\x83\xef\xbd\xb3 vowed to return to Venezuela \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xbfn the next few days,\xe7\xaa\xb6 even as he said he and his family had been the target of threats from the government of President Nicol\xef\xbe\x83\xef\xbd\xa1s Maduro, my colleagues reported :\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa8uaid\xef\xbe\x83\xef\xbd\xb3 visited Brazil on Thursday as he prepared for one of the most momentous decisions of his career \xe7\xaa\xb6 how to return to his country without being arrested and risking the collapse of his campaign to oust the government.\xc2\xa0On Tuesday, the opposition said he would be back in Venezuela within 72 hours. That now seems highly unlikely.\n"Guaid\xef\xbe\x83\xef\xbd\xb3, whose claim on the Venezuelan presidency has been recognized by the United States and more than 50 other nations, traveled to Colombia last Friday, defying a court order prohibiting him from leaving the country. Opposition leaders had hoped that day would be a turning point in Venezuela\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 political crisis, with the military forced to allow in tons of international humanitarian aid stationed at the borders. Instead, the armed forces largely stayed loyal to Maduro. Guaid\xef\xbe\x83\xef\xbd\xb3, during a Bogota meeting with Vice President Pence and leaders of neighboring countries on Monday, broached the possibility of enlisting\xc2\xa0 outside military help to oust the sitting Venezuelan president. \xe7\xaa\xb6\n\xc2\xa0\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gestures as he delivers a statement in Jerusalem on Feb. 28, 2019. (Sebastian Scheiner/Associated Press)\nJail to the chief?\nIsrael\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 attorney general recommended Thursday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust in connection with three corruption cases, casting uncertainty over his political future just six weeks before he faces reelection.\nAttorney General Avichai Mandelblit outlined the cases against the prime minister in a 57-page letter sent to Netanyahu\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 lawyers.\nNetanyahu, who has strongly denied the allegations against him, now has the opportunity to present his defense at a hearing before Mandelblit makes a final decision on an indictment. But the recommendation indicates that Israel\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 top legal authority believes there is enough evidence to proceed with a trial.\nThe legal challenge is a serious blow to Netanyahu ahead of April 9 elections, which he had been predicted to win comfortably on the way to becoming the longest serving prime minister in Israel\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 history. But in recent weeks, as the attorney general\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 announcement neared, Netanyahu slipped to second place in some polls, especially after his two main rivals, Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid, decided to run against him on a joint ticket.\nPolls have projected that the indictment announcement could cost Netanyahu\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 party another four seats in parliament. Even if he does win, the scandal could make it more difficult for Netanyahu to build the coalition he needs to govern.\nHours after the attorney general\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 recommendations became public, Netanyahu addressed the nation. He described the allegations as a left-wing conspiracy to oust him and as a \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x82ouse of cards\xe7\xaa\xb6 that would collapse soon after the election. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\x9bon\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 let this witch hunt confuse you,\xe7\xaa\xb6 he said addressing voters from the prime minister\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 official residence.\nAlthough Mandelblit\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 recommendation was long expected, the announcement rocked Israel on Thursday. Television reporters crowded outside the prime minister\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 Jerusalem residence in pouring rain to broadcast their take on how the corruption scandal could affect the man who has steered the country for more than 13 years.\nIt is an uphill battle for any party to topple the Israeli leader, but an indictment could change things, said Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli political opinions expert who has worked on five campaigns, describing the potential indictment as a \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x87onkey wrench\xe7\xaa\xb6.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9ill he come under pressure to resign? There\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 a portion of his base that believe there will be nothing because there is nothing. But how many people will continue to believe that? It\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 hard to predict,\xe7\xaa\xb6 she said. \xe7\xaa\xb6 Ruth Eglash and Loveday Morris\n\xc2\xa0\nThe Arc de Triomphe is illuminated with the colors of the French national flag in Paris on\xc2\xa0July 15, 2018. (Thibault Camus/Associated Press)\nThe big question\nIt\'s been a few months, so it\'s time for another controversy over religion and identity in France. In the latest case, Decathlon, a French sportswear company, advertised a runner\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 hijab for Muslim women . What followed was the usual circus of social media anger, journalistic attention and condemnation of Decathalon by various French politicians sticking up for their visions of feminism and secularism. If it seems like a lot of fuss over a piece of athletic wear, you\'re not alone. So we asked Post Paris correspondent James McAuley: Why did this controversy erupt?\n"Headscarf scandals flare up fairly regularly in France. This is mostly to do with the country\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 strict embrace of secularism and particular view of national identity, which prizes collective cohesion over individual attachments to particular groups.\n"\'It\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 a vision of the woman that I do not share,\' said Agn\xef\xbe\x83\xef\xbd\xa8s Buzyn, France\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 health minister, to French radio on Tuesday morning. \'All that leads to differentiation bothers me,\' she added. \'I would have preferred a French brand not to promote the veil.\'\n"\'My choice as a woman and a citizen will be to no longer trust a brand that breaks with our values,\' wrote said Aurore Berg\xef\xbe\x83\xef\xbd\xa9, a spokeswoman for the political party of President Emmanuel Macron, on Twitter. \'Those who tolerate women in the public space only when they are hiding are not lovers of freedom.\'\n"What\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 interesting, though, is that under the law\xc2\xa0women are absolutely allowed to wear the headscarf if they so choose. Nothing in France\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 famous 1905 law on secularism prohibits it. Quite the contrary: The law guarantees the official neutrality of the state and the freedom to practice one\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 religion. There\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 certainly nothing that says you can\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 go running with a headscarf on.\n"And France\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 approach to secularism is often selective. The state is officially secular, but government agencies close on virtually every Catholic holiday. Town halls, which are supposed to be neutral, proudly display nativity scenes and Christmas trees during the holiday season. But the controversies almost only ever concern Muslims, and what, exactly, their presence in public life should be. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n"In the end, after the pronouncements of these government officials, Decathlon announced they wouldn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 be selling the hijab. They\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x9b\x98 received too many threats, a company statement read, and they had \'to ensure the safety of our teammates.\'"\n\xc2\xa0\nFor The Post, Barkha Dutt argues that the tense standoff between India and Pakistan has been fueled by India\'s angry domestic climate.
