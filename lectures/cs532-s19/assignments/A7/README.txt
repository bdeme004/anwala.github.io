'asst7.py' is the main file for this assignment.

Report is still in progress; I'll upload as soon as I can (so sorry).

'generatefeedvector.py' is the PCI code referenced in the lecture slides.
I based several funcitons off this code; these are noted in 'asst7.py'.

'clusters.py' is the PCI code referenced in the lecture slides.
It is included in 'asst6.py' with the statement 'import clusters' and used directly.

'getthetitles.py' is the code I wrote to collect the titles of the blogs after collecting feeds.
(I had forgotten to collect the titles at the time I downloaded the other data.)
'getthetitles.py' is not otherwise essential for the main assignment.

'findpdf.py' is a slightly modified version of my solution to A1; I used it in collecting blogs.
'findpdf.py' is not otherwise essential for the main assignment.

'blogs.txt' is a list of urls to the blogs I used for this assignment.

'blogdata.txt' contains the blog titles and the post titles as lists of terms, in JSON format.

'blogdata1.txt' is the term matrix generated by 'asst7.py'.

'results/blogclust.txt' and 'results/blogclust.jpg' are the ASCII and JPEG dendograms, respectively, for Q2.

'results/kclusters.txt' is the clustering information for Q3.

'results/blogs2d.jpg' is the JPEG of blogs required in Q4.

Again, I'll have the report in as soon as I can!
