Hey everyone, I was wondering if you guys are able to meet on Wednesday next week in between 1-4:30 to do the project review session? I will not be able to attend the normal recitation time next Friday because I will be gone for military training, and I will not have access to a computer during that time. I have already explained my situation to the professor and he said the times above would be fine. Thank you all for understanding.  == not spam

We didn’t have anything scheduled but Austen just sent out an invite, let me see if I can add you to it. For the project go to the phrase 2 page and make sure you use ur cs login to login to the GitLab and Redmine, once you do that we should be able to add you to the project. == not spam
Hi guys, can you let me know what time would work for you for our review meeting tomorrow. I need to let Zeil know so he can change it. == not spam
So it looks like 3:30 tomorrow works for pretty much everyone. Austen can you make this time?  == not spam

Hey, everyone. I\'m so, so sorry for jumping in so late again! Can somebody please let me know where we\'re at and what I should be doing right now? I\'ll gladly help with anything I can.  == not spam
Hey, everybody! I\'m really sorry for dropping off the face of the Earth for a while-- my health\'s been acting up again. I\'m all right now, though, and am available pretty much nonstop from now until Monday; just let me know what you need me to do. == not spam
Oh, did we have a meeting scheduled?! I don\'t think I have an invite or anything. >< It\'s fine if you can\'t make it but I\'m having trouble figuring out where everything is. Could you send me a link to the wiki page or something if you happen to get this?  == not spam
Cool, let me know if you need me to add you to the projects but they should be able to add you. Let me know if you guys need anything  == not spam
Hey, we\'re all working on our own parts. Just pick a story from the Redmine page to work on and try to push it as much as possible. If you look at the agile board on Redmine you\'ll see what stories we are on. == not spam
