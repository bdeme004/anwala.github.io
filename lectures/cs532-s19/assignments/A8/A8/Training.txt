I am sending this email Sunday evening. You can wait to read the remainder of this announcement until tomorrow, Monday, morning.  Our next lecture is 01:00pm Monday, 25 February. We will discuss my solution to Homework 2 and, time permitting, my solution to Machine Assignment 2.  Exam 1 is open notes, open book, and open Internet. This includes all materials I have provided through Blackboard. You may not discuss Exam 1 with anyone in any form e.g., in-person, via slack, via email, via carrier pigeon, or via Google Hangouts. However, if you convince Prof. Morris to help you, I will allow it. == not spam
