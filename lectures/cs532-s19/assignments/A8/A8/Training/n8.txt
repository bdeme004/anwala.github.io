Hey, everybody! We're getting pretty close to the due date for this-- has everyone gotten a chance to look over the Requirements Definition? There's a copy of the System Requirements Specification definition on the course Library page; I've also posted the copy I marked up on the group file exchange. Looking forward to working with you all.
