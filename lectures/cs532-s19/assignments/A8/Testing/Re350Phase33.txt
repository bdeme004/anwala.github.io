Hey everyone, I was wondering if you guys are able to meet on Wednesday next week in between 1-4:30 to do the project review session? I will not be able to attend the normal recitation time next Friday because I will be gone for military training, and I will not have access to a computer during that time. I have already explained my situation to the professor and he said the times above would be fine. Thank you all for understanding.
