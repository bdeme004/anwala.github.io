b'Data science\nCore technologies and tools for AI, big data, and cloud computing\nHighlights and use cases from companies that are building the technologies needed to sustain their use of analytics and machine learning.\nCheck out the full schedule for the Strata Data Conference in San Francisco , March 25-28, 2019. Early price ends February 15.\nProfiles of IT executives suggest that many are planning to spend significantly in cloud computing and AI over the next year. This concurs with survey results we plan to release over the next few months. In a forthcoming survey, \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa2volving Data Infrastructure,\xe7\xaa\xb6 we found strong interest in machine learning (ML) among respondents across geographic regions. Not only are companies interested in tools, technologies, and people who can advance the use of ML within their organizations, they are beginning to build the core foundational technologies needed to sustain their usage of analytics and ML. With that said, important challenges remain. In other surveys we ran, we found \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x91ack of skilled people,\xe7\xaa\xb6 \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x91ack of data,\xe7\xaa\xb6 and cultural and organizational challenges as the leading obstacles cited for holding back the adoption of machine learning and AI.\nIn this post, I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa4l describe some of the core technologies and tools companies are beginning to evaluate and build. Many companies are just beginning to address the interplay between their suite of AI, big data, and cloud technologies. I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa4l also highlight some interesting uses cases and applications of data, analytics, and machine learning. The resource examples I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa4l cite will be drawn from the upcoming Strata Data conference in San Francisco , where leading companies and speakers will share their learnings on the topics covered in this post.\nAI and machine learning in the enterprise\nWhen asked what holds back the adoption of machine learning and AI, survey respondents for our upcoming report, \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa2volving Data Infrastructure,\xe7\xaa\xb6 cited \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xa1ompany culture\xe7\xaa\xb6 and \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xadifficulties in identifying appropriate business use cases\xe7\xaa\xb6 among the leading reasons. Attendees of the Strata Business Summit will have the opportunity to explore these issues through training sessions, tutorials, briefings, and real-world case studies from practitioners and companies. Recent improvements in tools and technologies has meant that techniques like deep learning are now being used to solve common problems, including forecasting, text mining and language understanding, and personalization. We\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb5e assembled sessions from leading companies, many of which will share case studies of applications of machine learning methods, including multiple presentations involving deep learning:\n'
