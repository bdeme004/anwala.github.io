David Pierpoint, the vicar of St. Michan\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 and archdeacon of Dublin. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa9is head is gone.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nThe police are still investigating the theft, but church officials are focused on retrieving the head.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xb4y biggest concern is to have the severed head of the Crusader returned to us in any form,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Mr. Pierpoint said, \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xado we can let him rest in peace.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nThe intruders also defiled a section of the crypt that contains the bodies of the family of William Rowan Hamilton, a 19th-century mathematician who paved the way for modern quantum theory. One of the coffins was broken open and its contents were dragged out on the floor.\nSt. Michan\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1, originally founded in 1095, is one of the most historic parish churches for Ireland\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 Anglican congregation, the Church of Ireland, and is on the north side of the city center.\nIts crypt is made of limestone, which draws the moisture out of the air inside, and its methane-rich soil reduces oxygen levels, making the atmosphere inside ideal for preservation. Many of the bodies laid to rest there have mummified.\nSt. Michan\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 attracts around 28,000 paying visitors a year, who come to tour its small but historically significant interior, which includes the organ on which George Frideric Handel wrote his \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xb4essiah\xe7\xaa\xb6 oratorio, and view the mummified bodies in their open coffins.\nIn the last century, visitors were even allowed to shake the Crusader\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 leathery hand \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xb7or good luck.\xe7\xaa\xb6\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9e don\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 know his name, but we know he\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 about 800 years old and was probably a local parishioner,\xe7\xaa\xb6 said Mr. Pierpoint.\nBecause of the way the body was positioned \xe7\xaa\xb6 with arms and legs crossed, a common burial ritual for those who had taken part in the religious wars of the era \xe7\xaa\xb6 historians determined he had taken part in the Crusades.\nHe was also incredibly tall for the time, standing around 6 feet 6 inches tall, according to Mr. Pierpoint.\nThe Church of Ireland authorities say they have been inundated with offers of financial support following news of the break-in, but worry they may have to close the crypt permanently after the robbery.\nAnother section of the crypt was sealed after being vandalized in 1996 by three teenagers who broke in, dragged corpses into the churchyard and played football with the head of a little girl.\nMr. Pierpoint said he initially believed this week\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 incident had been a similarly mindless act of vandalism, but he has since changed his mind.\nWhoever attacked the church \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xa1ame prepared, with crowbars and tools,\xe7\xaa\xb6 he said, which were used to remove solid iron and steel slabs from the front of the crypt. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xb4y mind can\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 get around the insanity of it, that anyone could do such a thing.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nThe police said that they believed the break-in took place sometime over the weekend, but detailed forensic examinations are being carried out on the scene. Some of the robbery was also captured on CCTV footage.\nThe motive is still unclear, but the church authorities say they don\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 believe there is any commercial market for such stolen relics.\nThere are fears that the ancient head, unless recovered quickly, will quickly disintegrate once exposed to air with normal moisture levels.\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Mummy\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 Head Is Stolen From a Church in Dublin.
