b'Media Relations\n5 ways your online newsroom alienates reporters\nIf journalists don\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 love your online newsroom, your news isn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 getting picked up. Here are five ways your media shop could be running afoul of writers, editors and producers.\nBy Paul Maccabee\nFeb. 27, 2019\nSHARE\nIs your online newsroom a warm and welcoming haven for journalists whose coverage is essential to the success of your company?\nIs it an easily navigable, content-rich destination that rewards journalists with the information they seek and reinforces your brand\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 reputation for transparency and accessibility?\nOtherwise, your online newsroom could be a forbidding media nightmare, a swamp of digital confusion seemingly designed to bedevil any journalists foolish enough to attempt to learn more about your company.\nWe know that reporters love online newsrooms: Two-thirds of the journalists surveyed by\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0 TheNewsMarket admitted they visited a newsroom every week, and one-third visited an online newsroom\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0every day.\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0Yet, some of the country\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 largest corporations appear determined to allow their newsrooms\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe7\x90\xb6f they can be found at all\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe6\x9d\xafo serve as a dumping ground for old press releases, and little else.\nWhy should your company invest in a high-quality online newsroom? If you don\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 provide a digital home for journalists on your site, they\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa4l seek out less credible information from other sources about you.\nHere are five ways to frustrate and annoy any journalist who might try to visit your newsroom:\n1. Force them to fill out online contact forms.\nContact forms make it profoundly difficult to contact you, let alone figure out what you do and what customers you serve. In fact, you\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e going to force them to\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0email\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0your request via a mysterious email address, leaving them helplessly praying that someone, anyone, reads it before their deadline passes.\nIt\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 strange that as the news cycle for journalists gets faster and faster, the trend in newsrooms appears to be forcing the media to slow down to a crawl so they can email an anonymous media contact who may, or may not, respond.\nAn increasing number of newsrooms (such as\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0 this \xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0one from H&R block) don\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 provide a human media contact, but rather ask that journalists email, call an anonymous phone number or\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe8\x83\x8corst of all\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe6\x9d\xb7ill out a form and submit it. Make a journalist happy by stripping out the contact form or anonymous email address and add a name and direct phone number of a media relations professional.\n2. Bury your newsroom where journalists can\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 find it.\nIf you want to irritate reporters, force them to play \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9here\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 Waldo\xe7\xaa\xb6 on your website to figure out where you\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb5e hidden your online newsroom.\nIt\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 rare to find a major corporate website that has a clickable newsroom button on the top navigation bar where it can be easily found.\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0It is typically buried in the footer within the About Us section. At other times, the newsroom button is invisible unless you know where to look.\nGiven how valuable the newsroom can be, why not proudly display it on your home page for all to see?\n3. Only offer logos, podcasts, video clips, images and previous media coverage.\nWant to inflame a journalist? Restrict the contents of your newsroom to pdfs of press releases\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe6\x9d\xafhe older the better\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe6\x95\x97o that your most important content is not at the reporter\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 fingertips.\nYour PR staff can become publishers of \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\x99rand journalism\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe6\x98\xb6\xc2\x80 filling your newsroom with multi-media content, high-res images and video, a downloadable FAQ fact sheet or company timeline.\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xact\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 invaluable if background materials such as fact sheets, recent announcements, and photos are readily available online,\xe7\xaa\xb6 says Thomas Kupper, assistant managing editor for business news at the Minneapolis\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0Star Tribune.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x83ictures often boost readership for a story online and having background information available reduces the need to waste people\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 time with basic questions in interviews.\xe7\xaa\xb6 Eighty percent of journalists responding to a recent NewsMarket survey said that downloadable video clips and images provided by brands was useful for their reporting.\nFive years ago, most newsrooms catered to one audience\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe7\xa0\xb4ournalists\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe8\x9a\xa4nd chiefly served as repositories for news releases. Today, your web analytics will reveal that your newsroom is frequented by influencers, referral sources, regulators, investors, distributors, wholesalers, retailers and even your own employees.\n4. Make your PR team hard to identify.\nJournalists like to build an ongoing relationship with a PR or corporate communications person. If you want to annoy media pros, keep the name of your PR person a secret on your newsroom.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xacn the digital age, we\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e always trying to move as quickly as possible,\xe7\xaa\xb6 says Kupper. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa2specially with smaller companies we haven\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 covered before, it\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 obviously a huge help if it\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 easy to figure out who the PR contacts are and to get ahold of them right away.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nThe best online newsrooms identify the name of your company\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 media contact and provide that person\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 direct phone line and/or cell phone and his or her email address, along with a headshot so the media know who they\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e dealing with.\nEven better, do as\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0 HealthPartners \xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0has done and identify precisely which of your company\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 brands or service areas for which each media contact is responsible. Also, check out how\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0 Hazelden prominently offers its spokesperson to the media\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0and then identifies its thought leaders for\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0 interviews .\n5. Make your newsroom unresponsive on mobile devices.\nWhen a producer, editor or news writer brings up your online newsroom on their iPhone or iPad, you have an ideal opportunity to thwart them. Al you have to do is neglect to optimize your newsroom for mobile devices.\nAccompany any working journalist today and you\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa4l discover they\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e monitoring their mobile phone or tablet 24/7. However, many corporate newsrooms on a phone or tablet offer crushed text. Sometimes media contacts vanish from view. If your news releases are archived as pdfs, they may not read well on a reporter\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 iPhone or iPad.\nAs best practice examples,\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0 PR Daily recently chose some of the best corporate newsrooms on mobile , particularly praising CocaCola, Cisco and H & R Block for ease of use on a cell phone.\nCheck their newsrooms out on a cell phone to see if your efforts stack up.\nPaul Maccabee is president at Minneapolis-based Maccabee, a strategic public relations and online marketing agency.
