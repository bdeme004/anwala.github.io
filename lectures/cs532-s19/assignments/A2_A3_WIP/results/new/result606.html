In the success of the Oscars broadcast, which saw a big bump in viewership despite having no host , he saw his own obsolescence.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhere was no host last night, and the show did better! Ratings were up 11 percent. So today, people were saying, \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x84aybe we don\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 need a host anymore.\xe7\xaa\xb6 Do you know what that means to me? Do you know how terrifying that concept is? All last night I was, like, tossing and turning. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe6\xab\x93nd of hosts! No host! Hosts gone!\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x90\xae\xc2\x80 \xe7\xaa\xb6 CONAN O\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x82\xb3RIEN\nCreditCreditVideo by Team Coco\nThen O\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x82\xb3rien and Andy Richter, his sidekick, paid tribute to the awards show\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 most intimate moment, when Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper sang \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\x9challow\xe7\xaa\xb6 from the film \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa3 Star Is Born.\xe7\xaa\xb6 It was a festival of cringe.\nFive Years of Fallon\nWith Jimmy Fallon celebrating his fifth anniversary as its host on Monday, \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhe Tonight Show\xe7\xaa\xb6 went meta.\nFallon broke the fourth wall, leaving in clips in which he stumbled over his words and said, \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9e\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa4l edit that out.\xe7\xaa\xb6 (They seemed more like put-ons than genuine flubs.) His former \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\x9caturday Night Live\xe7\xaa\xb6 castmate and \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9eekend Update\xe7\xaa\xb6 co-host Tina Fey was seen backstage, watching the show on simulcast and sneering at Fallon\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 jokes. And the actor Ben Stiller popped out from under a Hashtag the Panda mask, only to diss Fallon and wander offstage in awkward silence.\nAt the end of the show, Fallon doubled down on the story-in-a-story strategy: He rolled tape from earlier in the day, with Fey and Stiller planning how they would pull off their supposedly candid moments.\nFallon managed to mostly pull off a regular monologue, in between it all. There were a couple of choice zingers at the expense of North Korea\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 leader.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\x8bhere were some interesting winners last night. For example, the Oscar for best animated short went to Kim Jong-un.\xe7\xaa\xb6 \xe7\xaa\xb6 JIMMY FALLON\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\x9cpeaking of Kim Jong-un, later this week he\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 meeting with President Trump. They have a lot in common: They inherited everything from their dads, and they cut their own hair.\xe7\xaa\xb6 \xe7\xaa\xb6 JIMMY FALLON\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x91\x82haos\xe7\xaa\xb6\nSeth Meyers seized on a CNN report that President Trump has been telling aides he wants to cause \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xa1haos\xe7\xaa\xb6 in the Democratic presidential race, according to an adviser. He compared Trump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 tack to that of Senator Bernie Sanders, who tends to be a lot less confrontational.\nSanders announced his 2020 campaign last week on Vermont public radio (a fact that late-night hosts had fun with ), and in 2016 he began his presidential bid at a low-key news conference outside the United States Capitol, at what barely amounted to a podium. Sanders began it with a gruff, \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbc\xa9e don\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 have an endless amount of time \xe7\xaa\xb6 I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb5e got to get back.\xe7\xaa\xb6\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xact\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 like we were bothering him just by listening. I\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa6 running for president, now leave me the hell alone! Also, why did he just, like, wander out of a park? \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe7\x89\xa2ometimes, I like to sleep on a bench to give my suit that nice, socialist rumple!\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x90\xae\xc2\x80 \xe7\xaa\xb6 SETH MEYERS\nThe Bits Worth Watching\nAmber Ruffin of \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xb0ate Night\xe7\xaa\xb6 was pleased with some parts of the Oscars broadcast \xe7\xaa\xb6 but not with the best picture win for \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa8reen Book,\xe7\xaa\xb6 a film she called \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\x9briving Miss Daisy 2: This Time, the White One Drives!\xe7\xaa\xb6\nBen Stiller doesn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 take any guff.\nWhat We\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb3e Excited About on Tuesday Night\nTyler Perry of the \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xb4adea\xe7\xaa\xb6 movies, who played a subtle prank at the Oscars, will talk to Fallon on Tuesday.\nAlso, Check This Out\nImage\nThe \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa8reen Book\xe7\xaa\xb6 team with their best picture Oscars: From left, Jim Burke, Charles B.
