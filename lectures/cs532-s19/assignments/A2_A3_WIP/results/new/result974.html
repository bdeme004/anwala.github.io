b'and screengrab and quote from cgp grey on youtube \xc2\xa0\nThe most interesting thing about our era where technical barriers have been wiped away for so many things, is that the focus is exclusively on the work. When you can make websites without knowing how to code the question is not \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x82ow do I make a website?\xe7\xaa\xb6, but \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbf\xa4hat should my website say?\xe7\xaa\xb6.\nI see this with making Promogogo. We make it easy for people to build campaigns that work really well on social. What used to be a treacherous nightmare zone is now as basic as writing a Facebook post.\nSo our conversations with our users pause briefly on the technical question but move straight into strategy, branding and how to run campaigns well. How to reach people. How to build an audience.\nfrom Technical Barriers to Understanding People\nWith services like Teespring and more where anyone can create a t-shirt business without any logistical considerations. The question becomes \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbf\xa4hat kinda of t-shirts do people want to buy?\xe7\xaa\xb6.\nMy three youngest siblings are all of the \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe8\xb3\x82en Z\xe7\xaa\xb6 generation. They were talking about some cool new fashion brand, as teenagers do, that someone from the local community had started and completely exploded in trendiness. I asked them: \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbf\xa4hat do you think is the hardest thing about running a business in fashion?\xe7\xaa\xb6 and all of them, in unison, without question answered the same thing: \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\xbche branding\xe7\xaa\xb6.\nHailley and I had this with the podcast. We bought $80 mics on Amazon, we call using Skype and some call recorder, and I edit in GarageBand. It still took us over a year to get it out the door; because it wasn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 right. We threw out the first two or three episodes before we found our groove.\nWe hadn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 done the work yet.\nWe had to develop our tone, our brand, our story, our work first.\nSo the only barrier to making and launching a podcast then becomes setting aside the time to record and edit it. That\'s the only one. There are no other ones. There are not financial ones, there are no gatekeepers, the level of technical skills you need are so basic if you\'re reading this right now on the internet, you already have all the skills you need.\nDoing the work doesn\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb2 just come first.\nThere is nothing without the work.\nThis is why \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe6\x9e\xa0rowth hacks\xe7\xaa\xb6 and \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe8\xa9\xabife hacks\xe7\xaa\xb6 bore me.\nThere is no hack. There is just the work.\nMusicians ask me how to get on Spotify Playlists, how to get a million views on YouTube, how to build their Twitter followers.\nYou wanna know how? Write a good fucking song.\nGo play it somewhere. Make sure those who listen know your name.\nKeep doing it until something sticks.\nEvery success story in the music industry starts with either a YouTube video, or "came across them playing some tiny stinky basement" \xe7\xaa\xb6 but they were doing the work. They were out there: performing, singing, writing, sharing.\nIn the publishing industry, you have to have written the whole book before you can get a booking agent. And you can\'t get a book deal without a booking agent. You need to write the whole book first. That seriously blows my mind. Like I thought you\'d be signed and then like get some payments up front, and an editor you can be like "hey, which version is better??" you could back and forth with.\nNah. Doesn\'t work that way. Gotta write the whole thing first.\nThe work builds a following, it\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 not the other way around.\nIn the words of someone much smarter than me:\nWhat\'s the best way to be successful on YouTube?\nMake videos people want to watch.\nI\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xa6 not trying to be glib here but when asked this question I see many YouTubers talk about the importance of upload schedules and managing your social media and collaborations and my experience says that\'s completely backwards.\nIf your videos aren\'t interesting no one will care if you upload them regularly and Twitter followers don\'t get you views, views gets you Twitter followers and people who want to collaborate with you.\nI know it\'s not very helpful advice but it\'s the most truthful advice I can give.\nWrite, Publish, Repeat\nCommunicate clearly who you are.\nWhat you are about. Post it where people can find it.\nHow do you start a blog? Write.\nWrite stories people care about.\nKeep writing. Keep sharing.\nKeep doing it. Do the work.\nThere is no hack.\nThere is just the work.\ntell me what I\'m missing\nHrefna Helgad\xef\xbe\x83\xef\xbd\xb3ttir (Habbi)\n'
