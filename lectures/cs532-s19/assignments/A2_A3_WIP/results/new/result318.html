b'N.Y. governor signs \xe2\x80\x98red flag\xe2\x80\x99 gun bill, will allow guns to be taken from homes\nOAN Newsroom\nUPDATED 9:15 AM PT \xe7\xaa\xb6 Tuesday, February 26, 2019\nPolice will soon have the right to take guns away from citizens in New York State if a judge decides they could hurt themselves or others. This notion is the highlight of the bill signed into law by the state\xe2\x80\x99s Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi by his side.\nThe law will allow family members, law enforcement as well as administrators and teachers in schools to report individuals, including students, to a judge.\nCuomo boasted this is the first \xe2\x80\x98red flag\xe2\x80\x99 bill of its kind in the country to include school officials. He stood before supporters at a college in New York City to celebrate. While addressing the audience, Cuomo slammed the president\xe2\x80\x99s idea to arm teachers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cArm the teacher, so when the bad person comes into the classroom there can be a shootout in the classroom \xe2\x80\x94 I mean it is really ludicrous and nonsensical,\xe2\x80\x9d he stated.\nThe governor argued New York\xe2\x80\x99s law will be a better way to empower them.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is common sense, if you believe that was going to happen, why would you sit back and do nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d Cuomo asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou protect the individual\xe2\x80\x99s rights, because you go to a judge and there\xe2\x80\x99s a court ordered evaluation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, second from left, joins New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, center, as he signs a gun control bill at a ceremony in New York, Monday, Feb. 25, 2019.

Any guns inside the their home could be forcibly taken away by law enforcement.\nSpeaker Pelosi also spoke to the supportive crowd, claiming the law is not meant to stigmatize people with mental illnesses.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe just want to identify, prioritize to save lives and to save lives of the person themselves, a danger to themselves or to others,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained.\nHowever, right before that she stated 99-percent of people diagnosed by a mental health professional are \xe2\x80\x94 what she called \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9claw abiding citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOpponents argue the law will take away gun owner\xe2\x80\x99s due process rights, with the National Rifle Association calling it the \xe2\x80\x9cmost dangerous\xe2\x80\x9d out of all the gun control bills considered by New York lawmakers in 2019.\nDespite that, the bill was passed by the Democrat-controlled legislature in January. The law is now scheduled to take effect in August.\n'
