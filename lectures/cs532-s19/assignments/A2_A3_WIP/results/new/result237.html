Cohen plans to tell Congress on Wednesday that President Trump is a \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xa1on man\xe7\xaa\xb6 and a \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xa1heat\xe7\xaa\xb6 who knew a longtime adviser was communicating with WikiLeaks \xe7\xaa\xb6 and who implicitly instructed Mr. Cohen to lie about a Trump Tower project in Moscow that was underway during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe extraordinary testimony will take place when Mr. Cohen, the president\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 former lawyer and fixer, publicly appears before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. An advance copy of Mr. Cohen\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 testimony was obtained Tuesday night by reporters at multiple news organizations, including The New York Times, just as Mr. Trump began meetings in Vietnam before convening with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un .\n[Read the opening statement . Find what to watch for here.]\nMr. Cohen and his lawyer and adviser, Lanny J. Davis, did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\nIn a statement earlier Tuesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, condemned Mr. Cohen as a \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xadisgraced felon.\xe7\xaa\xb6\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xact\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies,\xe7\xaa\xb6 she said.\nIn vivid and at times tortured language, Mr. Cohen plans to use his opening remarks to unspool a narrative laced with regret of his decade working alongside Mr. Trump, including episodes during the 2016 campaign that are believed to be at the center of investigations by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and federal prosecutors in New York.\nThe testimony underscores many of the unsavory themes and stories that have recurred in public reporting about Mr. Trump \xe7\xaa\xb6 he inflates his wealth, makes racist remarks, threatens his enemies and tries to bend the law to his favor \xe7\xaa\xb6 but puts them on the record, under oath, in the voice of a man who was one of Mr. Trump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 closest aides.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xac am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Mr. Cohen plans to say. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xac am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a con man. He is a cheat.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nBut there are also more perilous claims that could further highlight Mr. Trump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 potential legal exposure in the investigations that have already ensnared Mr. Cohen and other Trump associates. Mr. Cohen\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 testimony before the Oversight Committee will be his first in public, before Congress, but he has already spent more than 70 hours with Mr. Mueller\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 investigators and with federal prosecutors in New York investigating a scheme hatched in the run-up to the 2016 election to make hush money payments to a pornographic film actress who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump.\nMr. Cohen and his account will be subjected to deep scrutiny by Republicans, who have already begun to hammer away with questions about his past business dealings and credibility. They plan to use Wednesday\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 hearing to paint Mr. Cohen as self-centered and untrustworthy \xe7\xaa\xb6 a man who ran afoul of the law, including by lying to Congress once before, and then once he was caught, sought to spin lies about his former boss to reduce his time in prison.\nMr. Cohen will address his own past lies head-on and plans to use documents to try to bolster certain claims. He plans to draw a picture of Mr. Trump using the type of nonspecific directives more often associated with organized crime bosses than with American presidents.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xacn conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Mr. Cohen plans to say. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xacn his way, he was telling me to lie.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nHe will add: \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xb4r. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 not how he operates.\xe7\xaa\xb6\nMr. Cohen also plans to say that Mr. Trump\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 personal lawyers approved his testimony, suggesting that they signed off on him telling a false version of events to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. Mr. Cohen is meeting with both committees again in private this week in part to correct those earlier false statements.\n\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xb4r. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,\xe7\xaa\xb6 Mr. Cohen will say. \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xa9e lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.\xe7\xaa\xb6\n'
