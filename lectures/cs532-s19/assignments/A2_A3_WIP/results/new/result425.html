They're entertaining, easily shared experiences, and they tend to teach us a thing or two about each other's tastes.\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0Not only that, but movies can also be a great excuse to get cozy next to that special someone on the couch or love seat. You can't say the same for reading a magazine, right? No one ever got married after sharing a copy of Newsweek.\nBut some films, while they're great, are movies you should never watch with your partner. Why?\xef\xbe\x82\xef\xa3\xb0Because you'll probably want to avoid arguments, general awkwardness, or even an air of sudden distrust. Nothing makes your sofa go from snuggle-central to the creepy zone quicker than these movies. The films on this list are totally worth your time\xe7\xaa\xb6\xef\xbd\xa6as long as you're by yourself.\nPage 1\n"
