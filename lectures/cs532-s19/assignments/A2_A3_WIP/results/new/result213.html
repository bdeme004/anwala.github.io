b'EU News , V4\n* The EU Parliament, including MEPs from Guy Verhofstadt\xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\x86\xb1 liberal ALDE group, will attempt to impose mandatory migrant quotas on Visegrad and other \xe2\x80\x9cdisobedient\xe2\x80\x9d nation states.\nThe ANO Party of the Czech Republic is a member of the ALDE Group.  The \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\xb7orced solidarity\xe7\xaa\xb6 was also celebrated by the left-wing Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (everyone knows what this label really means) and advocated by open-border activists Gianni Pittella and Elly Schlein.\nSteered through the parliament by MEP Cecilia Wikstroem, a radical feminist from Sweden, the reform aims to implement the Soros Plan on Europe.  George Soros has become a major \xe2\x80\x9ccenter of influence\xe2\x80\x9d in Brussels.\nWikstroem wants to force her extreme multicult views on Visegrad and the CEE nation states.  However, she will be challenged by the leaders of the V4 and others in Central-Eastern Europe who have no desire to introduce the \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbb\xb8oGoZones\xe7\xaa\xb6 of Sweden to their cities and streets.  Despite her noise, Wikstroem is starting a fight she cannot win. Unlike Sweden, the V4 will fight to defend their people and culture.\nHowever, she is not alone in her arrogance.  MEPs from the EPP, socialist S&D, liberal Alde, Greens/EFA and the far-left GUE/NGL voted 43-16 in favour of Wikstroem\xe2\x80\x99s draft report.\nThe European Parliament even has their own \xe2\x80\x9cparties\xe2\x80\x9d now?  What a circus.\nHowever, even Donald Tusk was able to grasp the reality regarding this \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbe\x98oison pill\xe7\xaa\xb6 that will further divide Europe. The vote followed comments by Tusk, the European Council chief, who said mandatory migrant quotas have no future.\nIf the EU Parliament continues to push mass migration and relocation quotas, they will only further alienate the nations of Visegrad and Central Europe.  Mandatory migrant quotas won\xe2\x80\x99t be the only thing \xe2\x80\x9cwithout a future\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe European Parliament should be ignored. Progressive \xe7\xaa\xb6\xe5\xbd\x9cocialists and Democrats\xe7\xaa\xb6 from Italy and Sweden will not determine the migration policies of Visegrad.\nOnward V4!  Stay strong and united.\n'
